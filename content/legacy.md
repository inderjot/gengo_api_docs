# Legacy API Documentation

The latest version of the Gengo API is v2. Documentation for previous versions (v1 and v1.1) is provided as a PDF download.

We encourage you to upgrade to v2, which adds support for new features including asynchronous ordering (the ability to make simultaneous requests of large payloads) and file-based submissions.
