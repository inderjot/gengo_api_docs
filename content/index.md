# The Gengo API

The Gengo API helps you to take your service global. Whether you're integrating an option for translation for your
users, or building a fun translation application, our API handles a [variety of
languages](http://gengo.com/how-it-works/pricing-languages/) and [features](http://gengo.com/api/).
