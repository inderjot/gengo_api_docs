# Client libraries

## Library selection

Weâ€™ve created libraries for major programming languages, ready to drop straight into your code. Pick yours from the selection below.

* [C#](https://github.com/myGengo/mygengo-csharp)
* [Java](https://github.com/gengo/gengo-java)
* [PHP](https://github.com/gengo/gengo-php)
* [Python](https://github.com/gengo/gengo-python)
* [Ruby](https://rubygems.org/gems/gengo)

We recommend you still check out the [Getting Started](/overview/getting_started/), [System Overview](/overview/) and [Callback URLs](/callback_urls) pages so that you have a good overview of the API before you start building your app. And as always, please use the sandbox for testing.

Have a library that you want to see here? [Let us know](mailto:api@gengo.com?Subject=Client library request).

All code is provided on an as-is basis under the [New BSD license](https://raw.github.com/gengo/gengo-python/master/LICENSE.txt)
