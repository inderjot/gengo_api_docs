# Sandbox testing

### The testing area for your API code.

Whatâ€™s different about the sandbox?

* You can add free credits to your account at will, for testing.
* You can trigger the "completion" of your translation jobs (i.e. be a faux translator) so that you can test what your code does in response.
* Additional controls for you to manually trigger job status changes and other actions, so that you can test your callbacks.
* The sandbox jobs database may occasionally be wiped clean to prepare it for new features. As such you should not rely on the sandbox for permanent storage.

## How to use the sandbox

* Check out the <a href='/'>developer documentation</a>.
* Create your sandbox account
* Log in and visit your Account API Keys page to generate a set of sandbox API keys.
* Test your app, using http://api.sandbox.gengo.com/v2/ as the base call URL.
* Ready to deploy? Head over to the live <a href='http://gengo.com'>gengo.com</a> site. Create a full user account, generate a set of live API keys - and remember to paste them into your app.
