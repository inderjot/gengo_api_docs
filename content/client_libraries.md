# Client Libraries

## Library Selection

### Official Libraries

We provide official client libraries for a few popular programming languages, ready to drop straight into your code. We host them on Github, and encourage you to fork them.

 * [PHP](https://github.com/gengo/gengo-php)
 * [Python](https://github.com/gengo/gengo-python)
 * [Java](https://github.com/gengo/gengo-java)
 * [Ruby](https://github.com/gengo/gengo-ruby) (also a [gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/gengo))


### Community Libraries

Our developer community has created client libraries of their own (thanks!). These are maintained by the original author, and we provide links to them here for convenience.

 * [Racket](https://github.com/shawnps/mygengo-racket)


We recommend checking out the [Getting Started](/v2/first_steps/), [System Overview](/overview/) and [Callback URLs](/v2/callback_urls/) pages for an overview of the API before getting started on your app. You're also encouraged to use our [Sandbox](http://sandbox.gengo.com/) for testing your implementation.

Wrote your own client library in a language not seen here? [Let us know!](mailto:api@gengo.com?Subject=New client library).

All code is provided on an as-is basis under the [New BSD license](https://raw.github.com/gengo/gengo-python/master/LICENSE.txt)
